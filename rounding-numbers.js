/* The challenge:
        1. Create a file named rounding-numbers.js.
        2. Define a variable named roundUp that references the float 1.5.
        3. Use the Math.round() method to round the number up. 
        4. Define a second variable named rounded that references the output 
            of the Math.round() method, passing in the roundUp variable as the argument.
        5. Use console.log() to print that number to the terminal.

let roundUp = 1.5;
let rounded = Math.round(roundUp);
console.log(rounded);
